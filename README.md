# Simulated16-bitProcessor
A 16-bit simulated processor I built along with the compiler to run code on it since it uses its own assembly language. It runs on the digital circuit simulation program v0.29 (https://github.com/hneemann/Digital), and requires all of the dependencies to be imported into the lib file on installation to run correctly.
